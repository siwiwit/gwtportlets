    GWT Portlets is a web framework for building modular GWT (Google Web
    Toolkit) applications. This demo provides tutotials and examples for topics covered 
    in the GWT Portlets <a href="/guide">user guide</a>. The source code for each example

    Each of the "windows" on this page is a <i>TitlePanelPortlet</i> containing
    other portlets. The layout of this page is stored in an xml file
    and is editable in the browser.
    Click the spanner icon in the bottom right hand corner of the browser
    client area to launch the layout editor. Any changes you make are stored
    in your session and discarded when the session expires. Usually the page
    files are treated like source code and kept in version control.

<p>
    The layout of the demo itself (the title bar, footer etc.) is stored in
    a page called "root". You can edit the root page by browsing to
    <a href="about.html#root">root</a> and activating the layout editor.

    This content is in the content root of the demo
    (<a href="about.html">about.html</a>) and is being displayed by a
    <i>WebAppContentPortlet</i>.
