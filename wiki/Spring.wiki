== Chapter 9. Integrating with Spring ==

Spring is a platform for building Enterprise Java applications. It provides lifecycle management and wiring for application components (among other features). A Spring / GWT Portlets application will typically do the following:

  * Annotate WidgetDataProviders with `@Service` or `@Repository` to make them Spring beans
  * Make the application PageProvider a Spring bean with an `@Autowired` WidgetDataProvider[] property to discover all WidgetDataProviders

A complete demo application using Spring and JPA (Java Persistence API) will added to the distribution soon.
