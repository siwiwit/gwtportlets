#summary Frequently asked questions

_What is relationship between "GWT Portlets" and JSR168 (Java Portlet Specification 1.0) and JSR 286 (Java Portlet Specification 2.0) Portlets?_

None. All the good names for a "window on a web page" have been taken so it was decided to stick with "Portlets" for this project. A "GWT Portlet" looks similar to a JSR 168 Portlet but is simpler thanks to the GWT programming model. JSR168 and JSR286 are described here.
